// DSpace works with CSS variables for its own components, and has a mapping of all bootstrap Sass
// variables to CSS equivalents (see src/styles/_bootstrap_variables_mapping.scss). However Bootstrap
// still uses Sass variables internally. So if you want to override bootstrap (or other sass
// variables) you can do so here. Their CSS counterparts will include the changes you make here

// Customizations for "drum" theme

// Import "dspace" theme to use as base
// Note: Changes to the values in the "dspace" theme should be made
// ABOVE this import.
@import '../../dspace/styles/_theme_sass_variable_overrides.scss';
